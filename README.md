## How to push code to GitHub

To push your project code to a GitHub repository from this environment:

1. Click on the **Source Control** icon in the left-hand sidebar.
2. Follow the prompts to initialize your repository.
3. Stage and commit your changes.
4. Use the "Publish to GitHub" or "Push" option to link your account and repository.

**Note:** The GitHub buttons within the application UI (Login screen and Profile) are mock features for demonstration of user authentication and are not related to the project's source control.

## Getting Started

- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
- The app uses `sessionStorage` for authentication, allowing you to test User and Admin roles in different tabs simultaneously.
