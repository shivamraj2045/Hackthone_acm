# SmartQueue – Real-Time Queue Management System

This is a Next.js-based queue management system built with React, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN.

## How to push code to GitHub

If you are using the terminal and see the error `error: remote origin already exists`, follow these steps:

1. **Update the remote to your repository:**
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/shivamraj2045/Hackthone_acm.git
   ```

2. **Stage and commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

3. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

Alternatively, you can click on the **Source Control** icon in the left-hand sidebar of the editor to manage your repository visually.

## Getting Started

- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
- The app uses `sessionStorage` for authentication, allowing you to test User and Admin roles in different tabs simultaneously.
